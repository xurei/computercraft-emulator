		<h1>Computercraft Emulator</h1>
		<h2>Why ?</h2>
		<p>
			While ComputerCraft is a very fun and powerful mod, its interface is absolutely 
			not user-friendly and frustrating.<br>
			This project was born from this frustation. Its goal is to provide a way to
			write great software and test it before sending it to pastebin.  
		</p>
		
		<h2>Main features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Full LUA VM</li>
			<li>Syntax highlighting</li>
			<li>Error handling</li>
		</ul>
